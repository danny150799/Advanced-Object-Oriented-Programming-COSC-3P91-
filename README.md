# Advanced-Object-Oriented-Programming-COSC-3P91-
Advanced Object-Oriented Programming. This is a project so despite the name "Assignment 2", it is updated with new features according to other assignments. Read the report of each assignment for more details about each version. 

About the project: This a Java program that act similarly to Clash-On-Clan game on mobile. The player can build/upgrade buildings, resources, army and defence throughout the game. This a real time game so the longer the player play the more resources and stronger they become. At the 3rd version, player can attack bot and gain more resources, if they win of course. Otherwise, they lose their army and gain little to no resource depend on how hard they lost. At the final version, the program can be run as server and client where the server can host multiple clients at the same time using TCP connections. Unfortunately, there isn't any PVP since there PVP is not required for this assignment completion. There is a level cap for everything except resources.

## Assignment 2 
In this version, the basic of the game such as player able to build and upgrade elements of the town is implemented. User can build and upgrade but they cannot attack anyone else.

## Assignment 3 
More features added. Players can explore, see stats and choose opponents to attack or not. If they win, they will gain lots of resources and maintain their army (with a few loses), or if they lose, they will gain little resources and lose their entire army so they can't continue to attack unless they re-build.

## Assignment 4
In this final version, the program runs as a server-client where multiple clients can simultaneously connect to the server and play the game. However, there isn't any PVP mode. This version's purpose is to demonstrates the ability of student to write server-client based system through TCP connection.
